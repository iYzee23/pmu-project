    Take into consideration that one question must have at least 1 correct answers, but can have multiple correct answers.
    Focus the questions on key aspects such as the algorithm's complexity (both temporal and spatial), its similarities with other well-known sorting algorithms, its implementation details, and possible areas for improvement.
    You are encouraged to generate additional questions related to the algorithmâ€™s unique properties or any relevant context surrounding it.
