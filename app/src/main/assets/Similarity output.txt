        "efficiency_time_comparison": "Both the provided algorithm and insertion sort have a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) and a best-case of O(n) when the data is already sorted.",
        "efficiency_space_comparison": "Both use O(1) of extra space, making them in-place algorithms. The provided algorithm also stores steps, which increases space complexity to O(n^2) in the worst case.",
        "implementation_comparison": "The provided code closely follows the standard insertion sort with an added feature of tracking and storing intermediate steps.",
        "use_cases_comparison": "Insertion sort and the provided algorithm are both well-suited for small or nearly sorted datasets. The additional steps feature in the provided algorithm is useful for educational purposes.",

        "algorithm_name": "Bubble Sort",
        "efficiency_time_comparison": "Both have a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). However, in practice, insertion sort usually performs better as elements are likely to be more uniformly displaced from their correct sorted position.",
        "efficiency_space_comparison": "Both are in-place and use O(1) additional space. The provided algorithm, when storing steps, uses more space for the list of steps.",
        "implementation_comparison": "Bubble sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements until the list is sorted, while insertion sort builds the sorted array one element at a time. The provided code's logic is closer to insertion sort than bubble sort.",
        "use_cases_comparison": "Bubble sort is rarely used in practical applications due to its inefficiency, except for educational demonstrations. Insertion sort, including the provided version, is more practical for small datasets or nearly sorted data.",
        "conclusion": "The provided algorithm is more efficient and practical than bubble sort in most cases. Its step-tracking feature is also beneficial for educational purposes."

For larger datasets, considering more efficient algorithms like merge sort or quicksort would be beneficial."
