    "intro": "The provided function is an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm which stores each step of the sorting process in a list `steps`.",
    "time_complexity": "The time complexity of the Insertion Sort algorithm is as follows:\n- Best Case: O(n) when the array is already sorted.\n- Average Case: O(n^2) as each insertion operation involves scanning and potentially shifting elements.\n- Worst Case: O(n^2) when the array is sorted in reverse order.\nThe nested loops are indicative of the quadratic time complexity in the average and worst cases.",
    "space_complexity": "The space complexity is O(n) for the auxiliary storage `steps`, which grows proportionally to the number of elements in the array.\nThe algorithm itself is in-place with O(1) additional space for sorting, but `steps` array significantly increases space usage.",
    "insights": "This implementation is efficient for small datasets due to its simple in-place mechanism but becomes inefficient for larger datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.\nThe `steps` list captures each state of the array during sorting, which can be useful for educational purposes or debugging but increases memory usage significantly.",
    "conclusion": "While the temporal complexity can be acceptable for small arrays or nearly sorted datasets, the overall space complexity is elevated due to the storage of interim steps.\nThe function is beneficial in learning or tracing the sorting process but may not be practical for sorting large datasets due to the additional memory requirements needed for the `steps` list."
